# Open Source SIEM Architecture

This repository outlines a comprehensive, open-source SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) architecture designed for end-to-end security monitoring, analysis, and response. Leveraging a range of open-source tools, this architecture captures, processes, stores, visualizes, and analyzes security logs in real time.

## Data Collection Layer

- **Purpose:**  
  Capture logs and events from diverse sources (servers, applications, network devices, etc.) in real time.

- **Components:**  
  - **Beats/Fluentd:**  
    Lightweight agents or log collectors deployed on endpoints to tail log files, monitor system events, and forward the data in a structured format.
  - **Log Sources:**  
    Includes servers, firewalls, applications, databases, and other systems that generate logs.

---

## Data Ingestion and Transport

- **Purpose:**  
  Decouple log collection from processing so that high volumes of logs can be reliably transferred and buffered.

- **Component:**  
  - **Apache Kafka:**  
    Acts as a distributed message broker that receives log data from Beats/Fluentd and buffers messages on topics (e.g., "logs") for downstream processing.

- **Benefits:**  
  - **Scalability:** Handles high throughput.
  - **Resilience:** Provides durability and fault tolerance in the data pipeline.

---

## Data Processing and Normalization

- **Purpose:**  
  Parse, enrich, and normalize raw log data to ensure consistency and usability for analysis.

- **Component:**  
  - **Logstash:**  
    Processes data by:
    - Reading logs from Kafka.
    - Applying filters (e.g., JSON parsing, field extraction, enrichment, geo-IP lookup).
    - Outputting processed logs to storage (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch).

- **Customization:**  
  Filters can be tailored to convert disparate log formats into a standardized structure.

---

## Data Storage and Indexing

- **Purpose:**  
  Store, index, and enable efficient retrieval of processed logs for search and analysis.

- **Component:**  
  - **Elasticsearch/OpenSearch:**  
    An open-source, distributed search engine that:
    - Indexes logs for fast querying.
    - Supports complex searches and aggregations.

- **Considerations:**  
  Proper index management (e.g., sharding, replication) is essential for handling increasing log volumes.

---

## Visualization and Alerting

- **Purpose:**  
  Provide security analysts with tools for real-time monitoring, visualization, and alerting.

- **Components:**  
  - **Kibana/Grafana:**  
    - **Kibana:** Offers interactive dashboards and visualizations directly integrated with Elasticsearch.
    - **Grafana:** Can be used as an alternative or complement for broader metrics visualization.
  - **ElastAlert:**  
    Monitors Elasticsearch indices and triggers notifications (e.g., via email or Slack) when specific conditions or anomalies are detected.

---

## Machine Learning and Anomaly Detection

- **Purpose:**  
  Enhance threat detection by identifying anomalies and patterns that traditional rules might miss.

- **Integration Points:**  
  - **Within Logstash or a Dedicated Module:**  
    Apply unsupervised algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest) to flag unusual events.
  - **Refinement with Supervised Learning:**  
    Combine with methods like Random Forest to reduce false positives.

- **Libraries:**  
  Utilize open-source ML libraries such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, or PyTorch.

---

## Integration and Orchestration

- **Purpose:**  
  Ensure the SIEM can scale, remain modular, and integrate with other security tools for incident response.

- **Components and Practices:**  
  - **Microservices Architecture:**  
    Break down the SIEM into loosely coupled services (e.g., ingestion, processing, alerting, ML analysis).
  - **Containerization & Orchestration:**  
    - **Docker:** Containerize individual components.
    - **Kubernetes:** Orchestrate containers for scaling, self-healing, and simplified deployment.
  - **API-Driven Integration:**  
    Develop RESTful APIs (using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI) to facilitate communication with other systems (e.g., threat intelligence feeds, IDS solutions, incident response platforms like TheHive and Cortex).

---

## Security, Compliance, and Monitoring

- **Purpose:**  
  Protect the SIEM infrastructure, ensuring data integrity and operational resilience.

- **Components:**  
  - **Security Hardening:**  
    - Implement strong access control and encryption using open-source libraries (e.g., OpenSSL).
    - Utilize open-source identity and access management tools (e.g., Keycloak).
  - **System Monitoring:**  
    - **Prometheus:** Collect performance and health metrics.
    - **Grafana:** Visualize metrics for continuous monitoring.
  - **Regulatory Compliance:**  
    Build in audit logs, data retention policies, and compliance checks to meet standards such as GDPR or HIPAA.

## Data Flow Summary

1. **Log Generation:**  
   Endpoints (servers, applications, etc.) generate logs.

2. **Log Collection:**  
   Beats/Fluentd capture logs and forward them to Kafka.

3. **Log Transport:**  
   Kafka buffers and transports log events on dedicated topics.

4. **Data Processing:**  
   Logstash reads from Kafka, normalizes, and enriches the logs.

5. **Data Storage:**  
   Processed logs are indexed in Elasticsearch/OpenSearch.

6. **Visualization & Alerting:**  
   Kibana/Grafana dashboards and ElastAlert enable real-time monitoring and notifications.

7. **Advanced Analysis:**  
   Integrated ML models analyze logs for anomalies and patterns.

8. **Integration & Response:**  
   RESTful APIs and a microservices architecture enable integration with other security tools for automated incident response.
